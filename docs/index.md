## How much g-force will you experience in a SpaceX Falcon-9 launch?

- Have you ever wondered how many [g-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) you would experience sitting on [SpaceX Falcon-9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/)? 
- Will you experience more gs accending or descending? 
- While powered by stage-1's 9 Merlin engines screaming or on stage-2 trying to hit the orbital velocity?

If you wanted the answers, here is a hacker project that can answer it all.

### Answers First

I analyzed the recent [SpaceX CRS-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-22) which delivered cargo including solar panels to the International Space Station.

There were two major surprises for me.
1. While ascending you will experience more g-forces (4.1g) when while powered by Stage-2 (when approaching escape velocity) than from Stage-1 (3.2g just before stage separation).

2. On Stage-1 you will experience maximum g-force (-4.5g) descending (just when engines fire back to slow the descent). No crew is onboard at this time and this probably also give one more reason to why SpaceX Starship uses drag to slow down a lot before firing the engines.

### Interesting Observations

Do you remember how just before Max-Q sometimes SpaceX mentions they are throttling down? You can see that moment very clearly on the stage1-g chart around 40 seconds where acceleration drops a bit.

When the stage1 engine shut off will you experience -1g force from earth's gravity? The measurments show only -0.6g. The 0.4g reduction is due to centrifugal force generated by 4000 kmph tangential (horizontal) velocity. For us to experience zero gravity [weightlessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness) we need Stage2 to propel us to 27,000 kmph in next 400 seconds.

Notice the U in stage1 velocity between 200 and 300 seconds from launch? Also, the g chart is a bit weird going from -0.6g to +0.xg. What is going on?
This is better explained by the altitude chart below. Upto about 250 seconds or so the stage-1 is still ascending hence the gravity is opposing it (hence negative), once it hits the top of the parabolla on altitude chart it starts descending and gravity starts speeding the stage1 again!.
