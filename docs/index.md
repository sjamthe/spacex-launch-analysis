## How much g-force will you experience in a SpaceX Falcon-9 launch?

- Have you ever wondered how many [g-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) you would experience sitting on [SpaceX Falcon-9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/)? 
- Will you experience more gs accending or descending? 
- While powered by stage-1's 9 Merlin engines screaming or on stage-2 trying to hit the orbital velocity?

If you wanted the answers, here is a hacker project that can answer it all.

### Answers First

I analyzed the recent [SpaceX CRS-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-22) which delivered cargo including solar panels to the International Space Station.

There were two major surprises for me.
1. While ascending you will experience more g-forces (4.1g) when while powered by Stage-2 (when approaching escape velocity) than from Stage-1 (3.2g just before stage separation).

2. On Stage-1 you will experience maximum g-force (-4.5g) descending (just when engines fire back to slow the descent). No crew is onboard at this time and this probably also give one more reason to why SpaceX Starship uses drag to slow down a lot before firing the engines.
