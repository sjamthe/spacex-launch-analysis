## How much g-force will you experience in a SpaceX Falcon-9 launch?

- Have you ever wondered how many [g-force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force) you would experience sitting on [SpaceX Falcon-9](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/)? 
- Will you experience more gs accending or descending? 
- While powered by stage-1's 9 Merlin engines screaming or on stage-2 trying to hit the orbital velocity?

If you wanted the answers, here is a hacker project that can answer it all. The project downloads image frames from a YouTube launch video and uses 
[EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR) to get the telematics and does some simple high school physics to get to the answers.

### Answers First

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/sjamthe/spacex-launch-analysis/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
